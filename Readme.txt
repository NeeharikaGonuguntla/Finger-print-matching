This repo contains the implementation of a finger print matching algorithm using Band Limited Phase Only Correlation(BLPOC).

The folder contains the following:
where BLPOC is Band Limited Phase Only Correlation

BLPOC_one_vs_one - The BLPOC code for checking if a refernece image matches with a test image
BLPOC_one_vs_many - The BLPOC code for checking if the refernce image matches with the images in a folder
Finger_print_matching_algorithm.pdf - The paper which formulates the algorithm.
DB1_B - The database which we have used
